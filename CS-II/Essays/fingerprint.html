    <p class="essay">
         Https is used on lamost ever website, but why do we use HTTPS? lefts first start with what HTTPS is. HTTPS stands for Hypertext transfer protocol secure also known as a
      secure version of HTTP. This is useful when someon logs into websites with sensitive information like bank accounts or other senstive info. If a websites are not using
      HTTPS then unwanted asvertisements can pop up or hackers can steal your information. HTTPS also encrypts communications between two entities so information is not taken.
      A way to secure communication is by using an HTTPS proxy. A HTTPS proxy is a call and repsonse between a user and a server that can be used to secure web browsers.

    <h2 class="topic">Hashing</h2>
    <p class="essay">
         Hashing is the process of transforming a key, or a string of chracaters, into abother value. This usually allows for a shorter, fixed-length, key to make it easier to use the
      original string. Hashing assigns values to data sothe operator can easily find said data which is why Hashing is so useful and efficient.

    <p class="essay">
       Organizations have the right to eavesdrop on our communications but not all communications. Organizations, like Allen ISD, are given the right to look at a user's screen due
    the possiblity of dangers like hacking or acquiring information that could be used to alter the grades of a student. However, Allen ISD cannot look at everything as personal
    information like passwords to other organizations not related to Allen ISD cannot no be looked at by Allen ISD.
