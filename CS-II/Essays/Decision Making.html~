    <h2 class="topic">Decision Bias</h2>
    
    <p class="essay">
      Often when people make a decision they are made off some bias so eithe the person deciding benefits or whoever they want benefits from the decision. The group that I am working with has an important task and needs to make sure there is a minimal amount of bias decisions made so everyone in the school is able to understand the cite.

      As we create the visuals for the arena schedular we need to be efficient with our time as those who are programming the internals of the schedular we need to be able to keep up with them and adjust our cite if they change their code. One of the biggest problems that could occur and stop us from keeping up with the other group is Analysis Paralysis(AP). AP occurs when a decision can not be made when faced with overwhelming information or environment. Creating a schedule for the whole school can be overwhelming to some people and they might just sort of give up on their part of the project. Fortunately, there are many solutions to AP. First could be talking the person through the code and help them write the code but the trade off of this is the person helping is taking more time out of their day which they may not have or be willing to give. Another solution would be giving them space. If you lighten their work load they might be able to eventually get to the level of efficiency to complete the project. AP is a real problem that can occur while creating the arena scheduler but knowing these solutions will help us get through the project faster.

      As we create the scheduler we must be fast but also accurate with our code. If we make a decision based on just trying to get it done we will certainly make a mistake in our code that will be made aware of when ten’s of thousands of students use our website to crate their schedules. This is known as Extinction by Instinct, when a person makes a decision based on careless planning. This can be counteracted by setting goals for the team to accomplish so they are able to manage their time correctly and experience as little pressure from either the teacher or from themselves for a easier process.
    </p>

    <p class="essay">
      Another problem that we can encounter from how fast we go to accomplish our project is attenuation. This goes hand and hand with Extinction by instinct because as we go we can not ignore the problems that we see. If we just ignore them it is the same as procrastinating an assignment and forgetting about it till you have to pull an all nighter just to get the bare minimum done even though there was plenty of time to create the assignment of much better quality. In order to solve this problem we could use the system the government uses: Checks and balances. Our peers could look at the code we have created through a repository we can create for our group to see.

      Anchoring and Adjustment is an important problem to respect is how we perceive our abilities when we begin. When we start our project we can not have low expectations for our abilities as programmers. If we have this demeaning mindset it will lead us to a low quality website that no one will truly like even though they’ll tell us otherwise. I believe looking at websites similar to the one we are creating can help us create ideas that are tangible and still challenge our abilities as programmers. This project is not only meant to be something that just causes stress and is a required thing. This is a learning experience for us and we could learn a lot from this project and what will help with that his having expectations higher than doing the bare minimum.
    </p>

    <p class="essay">
      The last problem that could cause the biggest problem during this project is base rate. Base rate is when a person or group of people ignores their original data and makes a decision based on the most recent data even though the original data is still vital to their decision. For example, in our project we are lucky enough to not be the first ones to create a arena schedule so we can learn from our previous colleague’s mistakes. How we could solve this problem is keeping all data that is currently important to our project in one file that we could look over if we ever need to a make a major decision like changing a side bar to a different location.
    </p>

    <p class="essay">
      All of these problems could happen while we work on this project, and i am not expecting us to avoid any and all biases, but I believe we can avoid most of them by recognizing the biases that occur often. Making a schedular is a cool thing to build and I hope that we can impress the students with our abilities and help make this stressful a little bit easier.
